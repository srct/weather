Weather welcomes all the help it can get. Even if you don't feel like you can be helpful the more technical aspects, we definitely need designers, technical writers, and testers.
There are many things that can be done with this project (see the issues page and the TODOs below), but sometimes it's the small things that count, so don't be afraid of contributing just a small spelling mistake.

If you want to get involved, join us in #weather on [our slack team](https://srct.slack.com/). If you need help at all please contact a SRCT member. We want people to contribute, so if you are struggling, or just want to learn we are more than willing to help.

Please visit the [SRCT Wiki](http://wiki.srct.gmu.edu/) for more information on this and other SRCT projects, along with other helpful links and tutorials.

Setup
---

To get started, make sure you have Meteor installed on your system.

On macOS and Linux, this is as simple as typing `curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`
into your terminal. On Windows, you can download the installer [here](https://install.meteor.com/windows).

Once you have meteor installed on your system, run the `meteor` command inside of the
`weather/` directory of the project files. This will start a local server for you to
use during development. Note that you will likely not have to restart this server while
developing as meteor has live updating capabilities.

TODO
---

- Grab weather data from a source/sources
- Put data in a database in order to cache it for users (and to not exceed API call limits)
- Show data in a nice way
- Create a beautiful frontend to view this information
- Optimize interface for mobile
